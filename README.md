Hi!
I've been passionate about games for as long as I remember, and it quickly evolved into making them ;)
Professionally working in Unity for about a year, but my experience as a hobbyist is closer to 6 years. 
Currently experimenting with compute shaders!

If you're creating anything procedurally, I'd love to help! I'm looking for indie games to contribute to.

I love to learn new things, and right now I'm learning how to work around the limitations of various SDKs ;)
