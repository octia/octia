Hi!
I've been passionate about games for as long as I remember, and it quickly evolved into making them ;)
Professionally working in Unity for about a year, but my experience as a hobbyist is closer to 6 years. 
Currently experimenting with compute shaders!

I love to learn new things, and I'd love to help you with your game!
