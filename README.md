Hi!
I've been passionate about games for as long as I remember. Making them since I was ~10yo, and making them in Unity specifically for the past ~10 years.

# If you are a recruiter:

Most of my projects here are very old - please keep that in mind :)

Most recently, I've been contributing to [Reflex](https://github.com/gustavopsantos/Reflex)
