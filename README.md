Hi!
I've been passionate about games for as long as I remember, and it quickly evolved into making them ;)
I'm closing in on two years as a professional Unity game developer, but my experience as a hobbyist is much greater. 

It's a bit of an older project, but it was made with the greatest care out of the projects here - so if you're here for recruitment purposes, I recommend checking out King Of Asteroids - a simulation prototype, capable of handling a substantial amount of objects even on mobile, due to the use of compute shaders.
